📊 GDP Data Extraction & Analysis (Beginner Project)
🌍 Project Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly data analysis project built using Python to work with real-world economic data.

The main objective is to extract, process, and analyze global GDP data in order to identify and visualize the top 10 largest economies in the world, ranked in descending order of GDP.

This project was created as part of a learning exercise to understand data handling, analysis, and visualization.

🚀 What This Project Does

✔ Loads global GDP data using Python
✔ Cleans and processes raw data
✔ Sorts countries by GDP (highest to lowest)
✔ Selects the top 10 largest economies
✔ Visualizes the results using a bar graph
